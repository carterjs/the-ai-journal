  <h2 class="mat-display-1 center">History of <i>The AI Journal</i></h2>
  <p><i>The AI Journal</i> was created by <a href="http://github.com/carter-js" target="_blank">Carter Schmalzle</a>, a student at <a href="http://lehigh.edu/" target="_blank">Lehigh University</a> for an English project. Carter saw the need for a website like this one while researching artificial intelligence (AI) for a research paper, then, given the opportunity to create a multimodal aid for the research paper, chose to make the website a reality. </p>

  <p>The idea for <i>The AI Journal</i> came to Carter after he struggled to find information for both sides when arguing that AI is a scary thing. He believed that AI would be an incredble asset for humanity, but that it must be kept in check. Unfortunately, it proved very difficult to find information supporting the positive aspects of AI even though it did exist. In the end, he ended up spending days searching for specific topics and keywords such as "healthcare," "manufacturing," and "art" for specific examples of AI accomplishing amazing things</p>
  <p>Carter hopes that in this journal, authors will write about topics objectively, sticking to a set of <a [routerLink]="['/guidelines']">guidelines</a> to ensure that everything is objective, fair, and of scholarly value. Despite these guidelines, the journal is open for all to contribute. Carter firmly believes that everyone has something to offer to the field, and that restricting writing access would result in loss of information. He was also inspired to allow a broad range of information by reading about the ways machine learning specialists train their systems. Only the most diverse datasets result in successful models. Having a wide range of perspectives represented withtin the journal allow it to serve as an invaluable tool for students researching or anyone else looking to learn all there is to know about AI.</p>
